##FriggFramework v1.1

My first attempt at a simple and modern PHP framework.

1. Clone this repository
2. Download [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and install dependencies with ```php composer.phar update```
3. Edit database settings in ```config/database.php```

In order to view the demo app you must create the database table schema by running.

	chmod +x console
	./console orm:schema-tool:create
