# FriggFramework v0.4

My first attempt at a simple and modern microframework.

Use [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to install [Doctrine](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2) and [Twig](https://github.com/fabpot/Twig) (or roll something else)

    "require": {
        "doctrine/orm": "2.*",
        "twig/twig": "1.*"
    }

Install with ```php composer.phar update``` and then edit database settings in ```config/database.php```.
