##FriggFramework v1.0

My first attempt at a simple and modern PHP microframework.

1. Clone this repository
2. Download [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and install requirements with ```php composer.phar update```
3. Edit database settings in ```config/database.php``` 

A more detailed description will be available shortly.
