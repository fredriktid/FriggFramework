##FriggFramework v1.0

My first attempt at a simple and modern PHP framework.

1. Clone this repository
2. Download [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and install dependencies with ```php composer.phar update```
3. Edit database settings in ```config/database.php```
4. Create your own app

A more detailed description will be available shortly.
